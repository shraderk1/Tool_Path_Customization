# Project Context
This project is a Python-based desktop application for G-code toolpath customization with a GUI. The code should be modular and extensible, with clear separation between GUI, G-code parsing, and future 3D rendering logic.

# Coding Guidelines
- Use PyQt5 for the GUI.
- Organize code into modules: gui, gcode, utils, and (future) rendering.
- Write clear docstrings and comments for all classes and functions.
- Leave TODOs and placeholders for future expansion (e.g., 3D rendering, advanced GUI customization).
- Prioritize readability and maintainability.
